For compiling all .java files into .class files, in Eclipse:
	package-explorer
	right-click the project
	Run As
	Run Configurations
	Set 'goals' as 'compile'

	package-explorer
	right-click the project
	Run As
	Maven Build

After compiling, can execute by running:
	java -cp target/classes/ poo.calendar.view.MainWindow


For packaging everything in a .jar file, repeat the steps above, but set 'goals' as 'package'

After packaging, can execute by running
	java -cp target/calendar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar poo.calendar.view.MainWindow


Compiling is faster, so just stick to it.






Creating new project:
	- Go to Eclipse
	- 'File' -> 'New'
	- 'Maven Project' press 'Next'
	- Press 'Next' again
	- Make sure 'maven-archetype-quickstart' is chosen, then press 'Next'
	- Group id: 'poo'
	- Artifact id: 'calendar'
	- Press 'Finish'
	- Erase the files App.java and AppTest.java

Go to the project directory, run the commands:
	git init
	git remote add origin https://github.com/matheushjs/poo_calendar
	rm pom.xml
	git pull origin maven_project:maven_project

Then try to do a 'Maven Build' as explained on top of this text file, with goal 'compile'
