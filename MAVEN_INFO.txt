For compiling all .java files into .class files, in Eclipse:
	package-explorer
	right-click the project
	Run As
	Run Configurations
	Set 'goals' as 'compile'

	package-explorer
	right-click the project
	Run As
	Maven Build

After compiling, can execute by running:
	java -cp target/classes/ poo.calendar.view.MainWindow


For packaging everything in a .jar file, repeat the steps above, but set 'goals' as 'package'

After packaging, can execute by running
	java -cp target/calendar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar poo.calendar.view.MainWindow


Compiling is faster, so just stick to it.
