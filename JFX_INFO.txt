For adding JavaFX library to the project:
	1) Make sure the project is set up for java version 8
	2) In linux, install javafx package "sudo apt install openjfx"
	3) In Eclipse, download plugin E(fx)clipse plugin
	4) In Eclipse:
		package explorer
		right click the project
		properties
		java build path
		tab 'libraries' -> 'add library ...'
		select javaFX SDK


Note: Since we set java 8 as the version for our project, the JavaFX SDK pluging might not be needed (TODO: check this).
