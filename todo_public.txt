1) Create interfaces Singleton.
	- Singleton for controller classes

2) Add groups to the calendar. There must be a class Group (or something like that)
   that holds information relative to each group: Color for example. Later in the
   project we might add a 'Defaults' attribute so that each group holds some default
   values.

3) Add to Task and Appointment the attributes (as properties):
	- Description
	- UUID (A string, leave it there for future implementation)
	- Group (Task and Appointment points to groups or groups point to them?)

4) Add a menu bar to the application, with items:
	- help: shows credits, short description and collaborators
	- about: shows the documentation (to be done later)

5) Save/load tasks, appointments and groups to XML file

6) Add date parser in the DateChooserDialog, so that user can write 10/06/2017

7) Re-implement TaskListView
	- Should be a grid 3x8 grid:
		- First line: labels for each week ( mon 01/05 etc)
		- Second line: Reserved for all-day appointments (future implementation)
		- Third line: A scrollable widget containing another grid, in which appointments are
		  displayed.
		- First column, third line: Labels for each hour/minute
		- Other columns, third line: correspond to each weekday
	- There should be a red(or w/e) line crossing the grid showing the current time (use javafx
	  Animation class, there should be a timed trigger there).

8) Add to the main scene an 'Add' button.
	- When this button is clicked, we can either change the main scene to
	  a dialogue scene where the user has many text fields and controls to play with,
	  or do this in a Dialog window (easier).

9) Add to the main scene a 'Delete' button.
	- When this button is clicked, the user may enter in 'delete mode', where all
	  appointments or tasks clicked are deleted.
	- 'delete mode' must change the background color of the main scene. Can do this using
	  javafx Effects class in the main Node (use sepia or change background to red?).
	- The 'Add' button (and whatever else) must be locked when in 'delete mode'.
