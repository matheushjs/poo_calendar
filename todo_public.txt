1) Create interfaces Singleton.
	- Singleton for controller classes

2) Add groups to the calendar. There must be a class Group (or something like that)
   that holds information relative to each group: Color for example. Later in the
   project we might add a 'Defaults' attribute so that each group holds some default
   values.

3) Add to Task and Appointment the attributes (as properties):
	- Description
	- Group (Task and Appointment points to groups or groups point to them?)

4) Add a menu bar to the application, with items:
	- help: shows credits, short description and collaborators
	- about: shows the documentation (to be done later)

5) Save/load tasks, appointments and groups to XML file

6) Add date parser in the DateChooserDialog, so that user can write 10/06/2017
